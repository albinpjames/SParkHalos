## Statistical Properties of Dark Matter Halos from N-Body Simulations
In the theory of cosmological structure formation, galaxies form in gravitationally
bound dark matter clumps called dark matter halos. In this project, we investigate
the statistical properties of dark matter halos using numerical simulations. In
particular, we estimate the halo mass function, which is the number density of dark
matter halo as a function of mass, for various redshifts and box sizes. Further, a
counts-in-cells analysis for halo mass function was conducted for redshifts 0.2 and
3 by dividing the boxes into smaller boxes of 50, 25 and 20 MPc/h and measuring
the variation of mass function across sub boxes.
